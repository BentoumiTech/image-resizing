A [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) that uses Cloudflare's [Image Resizing API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/worker) to automatically compress any image served from the `content/images/` path on a [Ghost blog](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost). 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Image resizing is available to Business and Enterprise [Cloudflare plans](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/)
